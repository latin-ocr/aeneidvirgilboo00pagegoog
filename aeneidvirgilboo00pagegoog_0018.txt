INTRODUCTION vil

From this time Virgil lived at Rome or Naples

:njoying the bounty and friendship of the Emperor
tud forming part of the select circle of distinguished
nen, which his minister Maecenas-the great literary
patron of the day-guthered round him in his mansion
ou the Esquiline. lt was at the request of Maecenasl
thet he composed the four Books of the Georgics,
written between 37 nc. and 30 nc, and dedicated to

him.² We know little of his life, but it was he who '

introduced Horace to Maecenas,⁸ and in Horace’s
writings we catch an occasional glimpse of him,
uutably in the description of the famous ‘journey
-ω Brundisium’ (38 no), when he joined the party of
{Maecenas at Sinuessa, and, along with Plotius and
{Varius is classed by his brother-pdet in a memorable
phrase among ‘the fairest souls and dearest friends on
mn’4while on another occasion Horace males his
nursing sor a tour in Greece the occasion for an Ode,
{inwhich he prays that the ship which bears so dear a
ltrust may restore it safe to the shores of Italy, ‘and
preserve the half of my life.'5

, In the opening lines of the third Georgic Virgil had
already announced his intention of attempting a loftier
theme and producing a great national epic‚ of which
Augustus should be the central figure‚⁶ and the Emperor
