VIRGIL‘S AENEID

V

Chant r of the Pollio, glorying
'in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakelese meadow‚
unlaborious earth and oarlese sea3

VI

Thou that ee'e'st Universal
, Nature moved by Universal Mind5
Thou majestic in thy sadness
at the doubtful doom of human kind 3

vu

Ligr t among the vanish’d ages3

star that gildest yet this phantom shore3
Golden branch amid the shadows,

kings and realms that pass to rise no morer

vm

Now thy Forum roars no longer,
fallen every purple Caesar's dome-

Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm
sound for ever of Imperial Rome-

rx
Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd,

and the Rome of freemen holds her place2 ¹

1, from out the Northern Island
sunder'd once from all the human race,

X

1 salute thee, Mantovano‚

I that loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.
