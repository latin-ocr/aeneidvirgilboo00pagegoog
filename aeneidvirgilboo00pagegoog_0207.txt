172 VERGILI AENEIDOS I

streame constantly speak of rivers es ‘swil't’3 they therefore
credit famous rivers with special swittness, as Virgil does the
Hebrus here, though it is said not to be a rapid river. The
emendation Eorum is not needed, though Madvig calls it (Adv.
6. 2) 0111331111 certissimaque 1001111111, cl. Sen. Theb, 601
rapidosque campos fertiles Hebrus secat where emendationis
impossible. See Henry. ’ ·

318. de more] ‘according to eustom’; whose the custon
was is at once made clear by the word oenotria.

319. dederetque] ‘and had given her hair to the winds
to scatter.’ The infinitivo seems epexegetie, further ‘explain-
ing' the phrase dederet veritis ; ol. 5. 24711.

320. nuda genu...] ‘her knee bare ond (having) her robe's
flowing folds gathered in a hnot' 0111113 acc. of respect,
endeticas may either be thesaure (‘gathered as to the folds')
or more probably the direct acc. aster collecta in a middle
sense, see Appendix.

Editors who attempt to explain the exact arrangement of
the robe of Venus, are as infelicitous as their sex usually are
when discussing ladies’ raiment. It is clear however thet
the robe 11 it were not gathered up in a knot would bea
flowing robe, and et 404 it actually does ‘flow down’ to her
feet, while Henry shows that colligere is the regular form
lor ‘gathering' 01 ‘tucking up’a lady's dress, being the
opposite 01 dcvnittcro, of. 0v.‚A. A. 1. iteponere si tormentarium
derreisso reccheoet, Ι colliga Amor. 3. 2. 25. Throughcut his
description Virgil clearly has in mind statues 01 the huntress
Diana, cf. 323, 337.

321. prior inquio] φθάνει προσαγορεύουσα, ‘she addresses
them first,' 11. before they address her. 1000831010...νὶὤο-
tis siquam: ‘point her out if you have seen any...,' not
‘tellure whether you have seen,’ which would requireri
videritis.

323, succinctam pharetra...] Tho adj. 3111101113 ‘girt
up’s expresses that the hanging robe is drawn up and held by
a girdle so as to leave the lower limbs free (cf. 1 Kings xviii.
46 ί11111011 girded up his loins aud ran before Ahab'); hence
soocchectu is used of the huntress Diana, es. Or. Met. 10. 536
reuda penu, oestron riter succincte Dianae. Here sreccrlzctom
pharetro means that the quiver hange from the belt which
holds the robe up, cf. Livy 7. 51111110 succinctus ‘with a knise
in his belt' With tepenter the word is perhaps used 111010
