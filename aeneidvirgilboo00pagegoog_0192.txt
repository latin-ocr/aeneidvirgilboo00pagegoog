NOTES 157

‘²³³ agrove overhangs gloomy with dreadful darkness’ Scaena
seems used as in G. 3. 24 where it certainly means ‘ background.’
3: Originally rustic plays seem to have been acted in some con-
:- venient spot where trees or shrubs formed a natural background,
ς cra background was made oi boughs‚ cf. Ov. Ars Am. 1. 106
v fraadcs Ι sinpliciter positae scaena sinc arte fnit Servius
rightly refers Virgil's use of scaena here to this primitive custom

-Drcta scancia ἀπὸ τῆς σκιᾶς, apud antiquas caina theatralis scania
paranni non babuit, scd dc frnalibus nrnbcacnla generabant.

comrscis: refers to the movement cf the trec tops which are
‘gleaming’ as they wave to and iro. There is thus perhaps
au artistic contrast between them and the lower part cf the
grove which ‘lcwcrs glcomy with aue-inspiring shada‘ Many
however take barram nnchra as ‘bristling shade‚' but this
seems a mere repetition of coruscis.

167. vivo] ‘natural'z the rock forms scats without being
artificially hewn3 ci. 3. 688 n.‚ G. 2. 469 cici iacias.

168. Nympharum domus] Hom. Od. 13. 104 ἱρὸν νυμφάων.
The Nymphs were often associated with grottoes and most
frequently with springs of fresh water3 hence in later poets
nympha isscmetimes= ‘watcr,’ cf. lympha.

hic fessae...: ‘here 1'10 bonds (ic. rables) confine tho

, wcary barks, no anchor with crooked fang sctters them) For

l

fessas Conington well compares Rom. and Juliet Act 5. Sc. 4
‘thy sea-sich weary bark.' The passage is copied from Hom.
Od. 9. 136 ἐν δὲ λιμὴν εὔορμος, ἵν’ οὐ χρεὼ πείσματός ἐστιν l οὔτ’
εὐνὰς βαλέειν. The substitution ol ancara for εὐναί (¹la1gc
stones') is an anachronism, ,as anchore were unknown in
Homeric times, cf. too cirenas 182.

ᾗῚΙΞῘΙᾟΒΡΒἈ] ‘seeks sheltcr.' telluris amore: ‘longing sor
e an.

173. tabentes] must he rendered ‘dripping’ but tahas
means ‘wasting away,’ ‘decay,' ‘the moisture cf dccay,’ so that
nanas strongly suggests the miscry of their plight.

175. succepit] For the spelling cf. 6. 249 n.

176. rapuitque in fomite flammam] ‘and quickly caught
the flame on tinden’ Servius says that sanas means ‘clrips'
(assalac) and derives it srom focca-qnod ipram faccia. Virgil
seems to describe first a spark struck from the flint, thcn
its reception on one or two dry leaves round which other ‘dry
socd' of the same nature is placed, and finally a fleme breaking
out which is ‘eagerly caught’ on small picces ol arcad. For
scaras cf. Lucan 8. 776 cacitat iccaalidas adiano fancitc staminas.
