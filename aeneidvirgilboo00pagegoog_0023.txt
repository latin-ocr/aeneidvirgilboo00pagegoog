xii VIRGIL’S AENEID

consists of a quantity of short sententious precepta
thrown into a poetic form. Such poetry is called
‘didactic' because its aim is to convey instruction.
In early ages, when writing is unknown or little used,
proverbs and precepts are naturally cast into a poetic
mould for the simple reason that they are thus rendered
less liable to alteration and more easy of recollectionl
Even when prose writing has become common a phil·
osopher or a preacher may endeavour to render hit
subject more attractive by elothing it in poetic dress
and so ‘touching it with the Muses’ charm,'² while
shortly before Virgil began to write Lucretius hac'
so embodied the philosophie system of Epicurus in hir
De Rerum Natura. That splendid poem was constantly
in Virgil’s mind when he wrote the Georgics‚ but
though he found in Lucretius a source of inspiratior
and in Hesiod a model, he differs widely from then
both. Hesiod wrote didactic poetry because in his day
it was practically useful‚ Lucretius wrote it in thr
interests of what he believed to be philosophica}
truth; Virgil’s object is on the other hand not
primarily to instruct but to please. What he writer
is excellent sense, for he thoroughly understood hir
subject, and his love for agriculture and the ‘divine
country' is undoubtedly genuine, but he writes tt
gratify the artistic and literary tastes of his readers
and not with any practical aim. The characteristic
indeed of the Georgics is their consummate art. They
are written with slow3 and elaborate care. Each line
