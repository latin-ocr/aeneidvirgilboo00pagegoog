noras 175

345. intactam] ‘amaiden’ primisque... : ‘and had united
her (to him) in earliest wedlock’: ominibus refers to taking
the auspices without which the Romans never entered on any
solemn or important business. It was especially necessary
that marriage should be celebrated at certain lucky seasons
and on lucky days.

347. scelere ante...] ‘in crime beyond all other men more .
monstrous.' After unic aiios omncs the comparative inmanior
is very striking. The phrase expresses an intense degree of
cruelty (auctionem auctioni addit, Priscian). cf. 4. 141 crete
aiios pulciecrrineus enorme, and our own phrase ‘the Most
Higbest’ which is common in the Prayer Book (cp. Ps. lxxxii.
6). For other strengthenings of superlatives, of. 2. 426 n.

349. inpius ante aras...] ‘godlessly before the altars and
blinded with lust of gold! Virgil marks that his avarica
made him blind to the monstrous nature of his dead, which
was not only murder, but the murder of a kinsman treacherously
(cf. clam, incautum) in a manner which was speeially ‘impious’
thetis to say, on the very hearth and before the altar of the
household gods. That arcs refers to the altars of the Pcrcaics
is clear from domes 356 and expressly stated 4. 20 post fcta
Sychaei Ι coniugia ci sparsos fraterna ccede Pcrccics.

350. securus amorum...] ‘beedless of his sister’s love (for
her husband).'

351. et aegram...] ‘and by many pretexts cruelly deceived
her pining love with empty hope.¹

354. ora modis...] ‘u lifting a visage pale in wondrous
wise' The phrase is from buca. 1. 123 simulacra modispcllcniia

miris, which Virgil copies verbatim G. 1. 477. The alliteration
of enodis miris gives a mystieal character to the words.

356. nudavit] ‘laid bare': metaphorically with crue, liter-
ally with pectore. caecum: ‘dark’ and so ‘secret’ ‘hidden’

358. auxiliumque...] ‘and to eid her lliglrt diseloses
treasures long hid in the earth! ·

360. his] ic. by the vision and its revelatione.

361. odfum crudele tyranni] Some take this as an
instance of Hypallage (ef. 180 n.)‚ = ‘hatred of the cruel
tyrsnt,’ but this is needless. Crnel tyranny begeis ‘eruel
iratred of the tyrant’; so we speak not only of ‘eruol wrong'
but also oi ‘eruel suffering] Moreover the ancients connect
crudelis with nudus and cruor, so that crredcic odium suggests
that the Ἦουηιί, which causes the feeling of hatred, is still fresh,
raw, blee ing.
