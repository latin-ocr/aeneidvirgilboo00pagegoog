BOOK I

The following lines ere sometimes placed et the commence-
ment of the Aeneid,
Ille eqo, qui quondam yrecih' hwdelatee avena
carmen, et ceremur silvie eirico coedi
nt quemvis aeide parerent area colono,
eretum opes emmelis ; at neree immeritem Martis

‘I em that (berd) who once tuned his ley (he. the Eclogues)
one slender strew, end then quitting the woods compelledthe
lliltlittplitfitill ttltlitlthltlld finiit
suhseryuently wrote the Georgice); but now of war’s bristling
arms smg....

The lines however ere to be rejected for many reasons:

(1) Thbey Sere notin eny good MSS„ but are first mentioned

uetonius.

(2) Arida meumque ere quoted es the first words of the
Aeneid by Ovid (Tr. 2. 533), Martini (8. 56. 19
protinus l'teliam cmtceyrit et armo virumque), end
Persius (1. 96).

(3) The commencement erma... is en imitation of the first
line ef the iliad μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά,... and thet os the
Odyssey‚ ἄνδρα μοι, ἔννεπε, Momm...

(4) That e summery of the poet’s history should be intro-
duced in the seme opening sentence with a summary
of the hero’s history is extremely hersh. Moreover,
the sentence becomes very long end ugly ; the omis-
sion τοο of sem twice over in the first line is very
objectioneble.
