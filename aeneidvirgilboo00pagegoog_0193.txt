158 VERGILI AENEIDOS 1

Others render ‘aad senned the fleme amid the tinder,’ bui this
use ol rupere needs prooi.

177. cerealia arma] ‘the implements ο1 Ceres* z a dignified ,
phrase (ci. the French balterie ele euisine) for the implements
used in preparing corn 1ο1 food ; ep. a hand-mill.

178. fessi rerum] ‘weary of their fortunas) The genitive
seems 1ο depend on the sense oi ‘having had enough of’ oon·
iained infessus, cf. Hor. Od 2. 6. 7 lasso maris.

179. θ11ο11θ1ο...] For making grain into meal (ferino)
11 was commonly pounded (pinso, cf. pistor) in a mortar witha
pesile, for which Virgil uses the phrase fronpere sano. Before
this was done, however, it was usual 1ο roast or dry 11 (cf. G.
1. 267), and so sar from this roasting being a special process
used here because the grain was wei (of. 177), 11 was quite
common to steep 11 before roasiing. See Henry 1. 479.

180. scopulum] 01. 163 n. ob omnem...peue: these
words explain why he climbs the crag3 ‘he seelrs all the view
iar and wide over the sea’ Prosperina being a verbal noun
11111111111111111..ἰὶ lualid {llil ll
prospaeeeus.

Ornuern is usually explained as a transserence (Hypallage) oi
the adjective from iis proper noun (pelope) 1ο another—‘ a view
over all the sea’; but, though such transference makes the
serrse easier and more prosam, Virgil could not have written
enarrem prospectum unless the adjective could properly apply to
tho noun. Aeneas was on the shore with a partial view, but
by climbing the rock he knew he would get ‘all tho view,' ie.
ihc full view he wished.

181. Anthea sl quem,..videae] ‘in hopes (111. ί1011111)
hc may dotect Antheus 11 may be...or Capys...or Caicus';
literally ‘any Antheus' Editors say that siquem is pub for
'sicubi=‘if hc can see Antheus anywhere,’ but this does
violence to the language. The expression is an exact parallel
10 Aesch. Ag. 55 ὕπατος δ’ ἀΐων ἥτις Ἀπόλλων l ἣ Πὰν ἢ Ζεύς,
‘but hearing from heaven Apollo u moy be or Pan or Zeus....'
