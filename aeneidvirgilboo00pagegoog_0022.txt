Dorians who' formed so large a proportion of the
tolonists of Sicily. The Idylls, however, differ from
ᾗ, theliclogues in a marked manner. They are true to
nature; the scenery is real ; the shepherds are ‘beings
Ξ of llesh and blood ' ;l their broad Doric has the native
³ vigour of the Scotch of Burns. The Eclogues, on the

³ sletches of rustic life written to suit the taste of
³ polished readers in the metropolis of the world.
= ‘Gracc and tenderness' are, as Horace notes,² their
χ’ chief characteristics, and the Lycidas of Milton is
ἶ an enduring monument of his admiration for them,
but true pastoral poetry can scarcely be written under
such conditions. The shepherds and shepherdesses
ol the Eclogues, like those depicted on Sevres porcelain
³ οι the canvases of Watteau‚ are ‘ graceful and tender,'
³ but they are imaginary and unreal.

a‘Treatise on Husbandry' consisting of four Books
f (containing in all 2184 lines), of which the First deals
³ with husbandry proper, the Second with the rearing of
j stocl, the Third with the cultivation of trees, and the
Fourth with bes-keeping. They profess to be an
imitation³ of Hesiod, a very ancient poet of Ascra
iu Boeotia, whose poem entitled ‘Works and Days '4
