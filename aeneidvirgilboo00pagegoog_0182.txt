56. celsa...] ‘Aeolus sits in a lofty citadel wielding the
sceptre.' Conington rightly observes thet ‘the citadel is the
natural dwelliug-place 01 a despotia governor‚’ and that so
here Aeolia is supposed to have an orec in which the despot
Aeolus dwells holding sway over his unruly subjects. Where
theare: was situated in relation to the prison 01 the winds

regularly used 01 plunderers (raptores) carrying off their spoils.
