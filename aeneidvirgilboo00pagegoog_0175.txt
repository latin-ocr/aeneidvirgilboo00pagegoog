1. primus] ‘first': tho previous settlement cf Antenor at
Patavium (ata-248) is disregarded, (1) as comparatively unim-
pcrtant, (2) as not being strictly in Italy but in Cisalpine Gaul.

2. fato] Some editors mark cfffato preafayas with commas,
thus confining the force of scta strictly to prrrfayas, but it ·
clearly {aas rather more with accit than with fate. Virgil dces
not wis so much tc om hesi'so that it was ‘his destiny to be
