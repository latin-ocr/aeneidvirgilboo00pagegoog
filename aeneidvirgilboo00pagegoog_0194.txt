11111 111 show3 ‘like the shialds‚’ as Papillon says, ‘of the
old Norse Vikings.’ For celsis cf. 3. 527 n.

184. navem...nullem, tres...oervos] Note the order of
the words. This is one of the cases where Greek would use
μέν and δέ 11 mark the contrasted clauses, but Latin simply
puts them side hy side, ‘no ship within sight (he views, bnt)
three stage he views....' cf. 76, 209, 2471111...111; 381 his
denas...cis septem, 467, 468; 2. 37411. eiii...eos; 4184 aecta
...iace; 5. 125 tumidis...treequilto‚ and constantly.

189. capite elta...] ‘carrying their heads high with branch-
ing antlers.’

190. tum virigus et...] ‘then the common hard and general
mob he routs pursuing them with his darts....' v

193. fundet] The subj. here after prittsqaam expresses
purpose: hs does not mean to stop until he has got seven, one
111 each shrp. cf. 4923 8. 38411. .

195. vina...] ‘the wine too he then divides, which kind·
hearted Acestes had stowed in jars....’ Deinde must go with
staec: Virgil frequently 'places this word in odd positione. 11.
5. 14 n. For the construction 1111111111111111,11111111 clearly
means ‘to put wine in jars so that it forms their 1111 11
burden,’ ef. 8. 180 1111111111111111111111111...011111’1,111111·1
breed is put in the baskets: the ordinary construction is ’
maerore cados cino, 11. 362 111111...11111111 asro.

196. heros] ‘like 111111,’11. 41211. Generous gifts ‘to
parting guests’ marked the heroic age ; 11. Hom. Od. 4. 617 πόρεν
δέ ἑ Φαίδιμος lipsa... Conington has ‘A brave man’s bounty
to the brave’ Henry calls heros 1 mere ‘eke,’ while A. Calvert
notes that ‘heros occurs twenty times in V. and always 11 the
end 111 line, except 6. 103!

198. o socii...] ‘O my comedes, 111 neither are we
before this ignorantes ills, Ο ye who heve borne heavier woes,
1ο these too God shall grant an end.’ The sentence is thrown
into 1 highly rhetorical form: if put into logical shepe the
soree 11 animis at once clear—‘God will deliver us 111111 these
evils too, sor we have already experienced many end heavier
ones' Some make raeque actim...mclorttm a parenthesis, but
spoil the sentence.

Ana can go with the present 111111.ι because ‘we are not
before this ignorant 11 evils’ is: ‘we heve before this hed know-
ledge of evils’ Cf. Hom. Od. 4. 810 οὔ τι πάρος γε πωλέαι ,· 5. 88.

For the sense 11. Horu. Od. 12. 208
ὣ φίλοι, οὐ γάρ πώ τι κακῶν ἀδαήμονές εἰμεν.
