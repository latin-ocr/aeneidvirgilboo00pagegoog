NOTES 151

luried' 101 we cannot construe ‘lies buried (sinin) by the
8perir’ ; moreover Sarpedon'a body was carried away to Lycia,
and Aeneas is not contemplating the happy buriei but tho
happy death 01 his eomrades. Bothr'ocet and coivit are graphio
presents: Aeneas sees in spirit the death of Hector and
Sarpedon, cf. 2. 274 n.

104. tum prora evertit] ‘then the prow swings round’3
averto is used intransitively, 01. 2. 229 n. The squali striking
the seii full in front stops the ship, so that she no longer
answers to ber heim but the bow swings round and ‘exposes
the side to the wcves.' Good MSS. give proram, ‘then it
(the squali) swings 1110 prow round‚¹ but after frangeretur rerne'
this return to 1110 nominative procella is very harsh.

name between Sicily and Sardinia, bnt it is vain to seek to
identify the particular rocks Virgil had in view, ns he merely
