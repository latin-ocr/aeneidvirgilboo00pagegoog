164 veneni Aiuarnos 1

243. 111yrreoe sinus] clearly by ‘Illyrien gulfs' Virgil
means the'Adriatic guli along the shores ⁸of Illyria, aster
lilla llllhinnulliittmtltllt ssttttlattdlt
intima cf. Livy’s phrase above.

245. unde...] ‘whence (aa. from the foas) through nine
mouths the flood eomes bursting and buries the fields beneath
a sounding sea’ Henry, who carefully examined the district,
makes this passage perfectly clear (1. 521-551). The Reca,
. which rises at the foot of M. Albio, the last of the Julian Alps
eastward‚ becomes subterranean at San Canziano sixteen miles
from its source, and alter flowing underground for eighteen
miles emergas at S. Giovanni di Tube in numerous springs, and
then2.after a course of scarcely more than a mile through the
flat marshy litoral, discharges itself into the Adriatic. lt is
this latter part which is Virgil’s Timavus3 the ora are the
‘springs' from which it emergas, and he describes it iu a state
of flood caused by the melting of the snow on the Alps. The
uacuare the marshy meadows on either side of the river, and
poleya premit urna sonanti is exactly the πελαγίζειν which
Herodotus uses of the Nile inundation 2. 92, ἐπεὰν πλήρης
γένηται ὁ ποταμὸς καὶ τὰ πεδία πελαγίσῃ. Servius, quoting
Varro, says that owing to these inundatione the river was
locally called mare.

247. urbem Patavi] Cf. 5. 5211.
Patavi: the close gen. ol nouns in ium is regular in virgil,
cf. 258 Lauini.

248. genti nomen dedit] ‘gave a name to the race'; the
phrase indicates that he settled his sollowers there as a people
with a definite name. The name was certainly ‘Trojam’ cf.'
242 n. and Troia here. arma fixit Troia: ‘hung up the
arms ol Troy' aa. in the temples as a sign of peace. For this
pusiam of dedicating the instrumente of any calling on retiring
rom it, cf. 6. 1811.

249. placida...] ‘in peaceful calm reposing rests.’ The
words might describe the unbroken rest of death, aud many so
take them, but Antenor is surely not described as happier than
Aeneas because he is dead. He is happier because he has
founded his city and finished his wars and wanderings. See

250. nos] ic. Ι and my son; Venus identifies herself with
Aeneas and his fortunas. caeli...: ‘to whom thou dost grant
the heights of heaven’ aa. promise a duelling in heaven,
