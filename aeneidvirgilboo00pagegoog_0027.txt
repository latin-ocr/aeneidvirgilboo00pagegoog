xvi ,VIRGIL’S AENEID

Turnus (10. 478 sep). Aeneas avenges his death by
the slaughter of many heroes, but Juno manages to
save Turnus by inducing him to leave the field in
pursuit ofa phantom of the Trojan hero. Aeneas alays
Mezentius in single combat.

Book XI. opens with an account of the burial of the
dead, and especially of the funeral of Pallas. Mean·
time the embassy of Turnus to Diomede returns with
a refusal, and a council is held in which his rival,
Drances, bitterly attacks Turnus, but which is broken
up at the news that the Trojans are attacking the city.
Turnus hurries to the fray, and is joined by Camilla,
with whose story the latter half vof the book is
occupied.

Book XII, after several minor episodes‚ relates how
Aeneas and Turnus at last meet in single combat‚ in
which the latter is slain.

The Aeneid‚ it will thus be seen, is a sort of national
epic intended to connect the origin of the Romans (and
especially of the Julian family) with the gods and heroes
of Homeric song, and incidentally serving to dignify
many Roman customs and ceremonies by identifying
thern with the customs and ceremonies of the heroic
age. At the same time Aeneas and his followers, as
through difficulties and dangers, putting their trust in
heaven, they steadily press forward to success, afford
a visible personification of those virtues which had
slowly and surely secured for Rome the empire of the
world, while Aeneas himself ‘as a fatherly ruler over
his people, their chief in battle, their law-gives in
peace, and their high-priest in all spiritual relations‚'¹
