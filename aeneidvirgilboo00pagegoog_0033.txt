xxii ¹VIRGlL'S AENEID

dignissima vita.1 The episodes‚ such as the story ol
Nisus and Euryalus or that of Camilla, have an abiding
charm. The debate in the eleventh Book deserves,
as a model of rhetoric, to be ranked with Milton's
account of the great council held

‘At Pandemonium, the high capital
Of Satan and his peers.¹

But, above all, it is in these Books that Virgil stands
revealed as a consummate portrait-painter. The figuret
of Evander and Pallas, of Turnus and Mezentius, ar<
drawn bya master hand. The first two have in all
ages won unstinted admiration, but the poet’s artistic
power is, perhaps, more truly displayed in the delinea·
tion of the second pair. Rough and turbulent thougl
he ἰι, yet, as he stands at bay in the Trojan camp οι
in the council·chamber of Latinus, as he meets hi:
doom beneath the sword of Aeneas, the figure o
Turnus is one which kindlcs the imagination an<
touches the Ιιιιιιι.2 80 too it is with Mezentius
Hated he is justly by men ,and abhorred by gods ; but
none the less, as he lies wounded and propped agains
atree‚ with his great beard sweeping over his chest
while he sends messenger after messenger to brin⁴
tidings of his gallant son, the grim soldier is a patheti=
figure, and the delineation of him (ιι. 8 56 seq.) a

¹ Lucr. 3. ις, See, for example, 7. 5983 9. 185, 2533 10. 111

4673 11.104; 12. 895.

r ² Although Aeneas is Virgil's hero, still his natural feeling seem
to be with Turnus, and, almost in spite of hia will, he makes hin
¹the more interesting figure. So too in Hebrew story, althougl
Jacob is the national hero, yet in the wonderful narrative of Gen
xxvii. it is with Esau, and not with Jacob, that the writer's humar
heart appears to beat in genuine sympathy.
