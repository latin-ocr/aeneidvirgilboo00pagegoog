vi VIRGIL'S AENEID

that rhetorical training which has left such a profou ιι
impress on the literature of the succeeding century. Ι
On completing his education he seems to ha'
returned home, and some of the minor poems ascri„
to him—Ciris, Capa, Culex, Dirae, Moratum-may·
in reality youthful attempts of his composed duri
this period. Our first certain knowledge, however,
¹ his poetic career begins in nc. 42, when, after ι “
defeat of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, the Roas
world passed into the hands of the triumvirs Octavi
Antony, and Lepidus. They had promised their, vr*
torious veterans the lands of eighteen cities in Ital
among which was Cremona, and subsequently it bec a
necessary to include the neighbouring district of M]
tua.1 Virgil's father was threatened with the loss
his ἷιιιιιι,2 but the youthful poet had secured the fa ι
of C. Asinius Pollio, governor of Cisalpine Gaul,
of L. Alfenus Varus, his successor (rac. 41), wh
assistance he invokes in the sixth Eclogue. Po '
himself a scholar and poet,³ accepted the dedication ¹
his earliest Eclogues,4 and secured for him an ιιιιι
duction to Octavian at Rome,5 as a result of which
obtained the restoration of the farm. His gratitude
the youthful triumvir finds expression in the Eclo
which he prefixed to the others, and which now stan
at their head.
